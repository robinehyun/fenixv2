ie10-viewport
=============

IE10 viewport hack for Surface/desktop Windows 8 bug.

Internet Explorer 10 doesn't differentiate device width from viewport width. This code checks for the version of IE that has this issue (IE Mobile 10) and then injects a stylesheet that overrides the device-width declaration in your CSS. This gets all Windows 8 devices playing along nicely. Windows Phone 8 devices will pay apply a friendlier viewport, and snap mode users will see a site scaled to their viewport size as well.

Similar files are included in all of Bootstrap's documentation and examples.
